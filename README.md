### Tumble
This is a Hidden and Dangerous 2 mission named Tumble.

Instructions on how to play it:

1. Replace mpmaplist.txt in the root folder with this one. Make sure to backup your original mpmaplist.
  a. Alternatively you can paste everything with the map tag in your own mpmaplist.txt. Make sure to paste it in the cooperative section.
2. Extract the other folders in your root folder.
3. Start Hidden and Dangerous 2 and start a server (Lan or internet are both fine)
4. Select the mission Tumble (comes from mpmaplist.txt)
5. Preferably use 1 life. This is so that if you die you restart the map. The map is not optimized for respawning due sequenced scripts.
